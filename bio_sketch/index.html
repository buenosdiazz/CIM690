         Hey friends, I will be showing you how to create a simple multi-layered illustration with depth that transitions into the content in a unique way. We’ll be using a technique that involves CSS and pure JS (no jQuery!).
The tutorial is for beginners with basic Javascript and CSS knowledge, so I will be explaining most of the things and link to external sources. (Edit: If you’re looking for information on how to start learning Javascript I wrote an article about it.
